Admin Tools

Admin Tools is a project I started in order to keep track of the non-proprietary scripts that I 
have written for System Administrator tasks. 

On my to do list is to add documentation to each directory making it easy to take the scripts, 
edit them, and use them for yourself. 

Scripts are used at your own risk, please do not run a script if you don't understand it.
